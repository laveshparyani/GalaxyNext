It builds on top of [ERPNext](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext) and the
[Frappe Framework](https://github.com/frappe/frappe) - incredible FOSS projects
built and maintained by the folks at Frappe. Go check these out if you haven't

### In-app Purchases

Some of the automation features available in India Compliance require access to [GST APIs](https://discuss.erpnext.com/t/introducing-india-compliance/86335#a-note-on-gst-apis-3).
